external-filter
===============

Eclipse plugin that takes text from the current editor, processes it through an external filter, and brings it back.

This is a fork that resumes the development of <a href="https://github.com/mihnita/external-filter">mihnita's external filter plugin</a>.

I forked it because it appeared abandoned and it **almost** did what I needed but <a href="https://github.com/mihnita/external-filter/issues/5">not quite</a>. I am completely new to Eclipse plugin writing and I am refreshing my **very** stale Java skills for this endeavour. This has several consequences:

* There will be bugs.
* You will have to build the plugin yourself. No update site for now, let alone a Marketplace entry, as I have no idea how to do these.

The specific feature I needed and decided to implement is the ability to pass the full path of the file in the active editor to the tool script.

Original info and screenshots are still available at <a href="http://www.mihai-nita.net/java">http://www.mihai-nita.net/java</a>.

TODO: set up a webpage like the above.
